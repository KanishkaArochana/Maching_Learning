Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

What is Dimension Reduction
Why use Dimension Reduction (Reducing the number of reatures, Data visualization)
	Have a two method
		1. Feature Selection (Important Feature Choose)
		2. Feature Extraction (Create a separate feature column set using Features (Principal Component is tacknic))

Defferent between Feature Selection and Feature Extraction

Reducing the dimension of the dataset through the Principal Component 

Explain step by step with ecxample wow to get value and show each step

Table => [X1 = 4, 8, 6, 6] [x2 = 9, 3, 8, 6] --> [pc1 = P1, P2, P3, P3]

	1. Covariance matrix (means)
	2. Calulate eign values (Take a hight value)
	3. Find normalized eigm vector
	4. Derive new dataset


I wont to documentation for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in machine learning sutable for markdown file and describe special method in code one by one
