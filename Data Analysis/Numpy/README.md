## Vectors Operations

### 1. Vector Creation
Numpy allows you to create a vector (1D array) using `np.array()`. In this example, two vectors `vector1` and `vector2` are created:

```python
vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
```

### 2. Vector Addition
Vectors can be added element-wise using the `+` operator or `np.add()` function. The result is a new vector where each element is the sum of corresponding elements from both vectors.

```python
vector_add = vector1 + vector2
# Output: [5 7 9]
```

### 3. Vector Multiplication (Element-wise)
Element-wise multiplication is performed using `*` or `np.multiply()`.

```python
vector_multiply = vector1 * vector2
# Output: [ 4 10 18]
```

## Matrix Operations

### 1. Matrix Creation
A matrix is a 2D array, and matrices can be created using `np.array()`:

```python
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
```

### 2. Matrix Addition
Matrices can be added element-wise similarly to vectors.

```python
matrix_add = matrix1 + matrix2
# Output: 
# [[ 6  8]
#  [10 12]]
```

### 3. Matrix Subtraction
Matrix subtraction works element-wise, using the `-` operator.

```python
matrix_subtract = matrix1 - matrix2
# Output: 
# [[-4 -4]
#  [-4 -4]]
```

## Reshaping Arrays

### 1. Reshaping Arrays
The `reshape()` function in Numpy allows you to change the shape of an array without changing its data.

```python
array = np.arange(1, 13)  # Array from 1 to 12
reshaped_array = array.reshape(3, 4)
# Output: 
# [[ 1  2  3  4]
#  [ 5  6  7  8]
#  [ 9 10 11 12]]
```

You can also reshape it into a 3D array:

```python
reshaped_3d = array.reshape(2, 2, 3)
# Output:
# [[[ 1  2  3]
#   [ 4  5  6]]
#
#  [[ 7  8  9]
#   [10 11 12]]]
```

## Diagonal Operations and Trace

### 1. Diagonal Elements
To extract the diagonal elements from a square matrix, use `np.diag()`:

```python
square_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
diagonal = np.diag(square_matrix)
# Output: [1 5 9]
```

### 2. Trace of a Matrix
The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. Use `np.trace()` to calculate it.

```python
trace = np.trace(square_matrix)
# Output: 15
```

## Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation

### 1. Mean
The mean is the average of all elements in the array. Use `np.mean()`:

```python
stat_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
mean = np.mean(stat_data)
# Output: 5.5
```

### 2. Variance
Variance measures the spread of the data. Use `np.var()`:

```python
variance = np.var(stat_data)
# Output: 8.25
```

### 3. Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Use `np.std()`:

```python
std_dev = np.std(stat_data)
# Output: 2.8722813232690143
```

## Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Dot and Cross Products

### 1. Addition
Vectors and matrices can be added element-wise using `np.add()`:

```python
add_result = np.add(vector1, vector2)
# Output: [5 7 9]
```

### 2. Subtraction
Subtraction works similarly to addition using `np.subtract()`:

```python
subtract_result = np.subtract(vector1, vector2)
# Output: [-3 -3 -3]
```

### 3. Multiplication (Element-wise)
Element-wise multiplication can be done using `np.multiply()`:

```python
multiply_result = np.multiply(vector1, vector2)
# Output: [ 4 10 18]
```

### 4. Dot Product
The dot product is calculated using `np.dot()`:

```python
dot_product = np.dot(vector1, vector2)
# Output: 32
```

### 5. Cross Product
The cross product of two vectors is computed using `np.cross()`:

```python
cross_product = np.cross(vector1, vector2)
# Output: [-3  6 -3]
```
```
